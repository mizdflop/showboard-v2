# MeteorJS Directory Structure Boilerplate

This is a generated directory structure with README.md files for faster development on MeteorJS apps. 

It is for personal use on my MeteorJS projects but feel free to clone it or fork it on your own concent. 

This boilerplate was generated before any `meteor create` or `mrt create` commands and it's intentended to go along with the suggested directory and file structure on the [DiscoverMeteor book](http://book.discovermeteor.com/) and the [MeteorJS Documentation.](http://docs.meteor.com/#structuringyourapp)

This boilerplate also comes with the latest Bootstrap 3 Sass files __not as a package__ because I prefer to compile them with `sass --watch input.scss:input.css` command.

#### Clone it with

        git clone https://github.com/netpoe/Boilerplates_MeteorJS.git
